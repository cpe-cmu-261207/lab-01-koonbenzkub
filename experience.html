I help my friends work and learn, it's quite difficult to start. Therefore, it was agreed to find a game like Mario and adapt it according to the horror game genre. And we help each other to fix it until it's successful.</p>

In school, we didn't study. I have been trained at the training unit. But as soon as I got into the training it gave me the patience and focus. because it will only be once We practiced dozens of days for just one real day.</p>
